    "- The first thing I did to dry off the code of the lemonade stand was create two more universal variables.\n",
    "- I added a variable for the price of the lemonade and a variable for the price of the pretzel.\n",
    "- This is helpful because now the price of the pretzel and the price of the lemonade can change easily without going throguhout the entire code.\n",
    "- I also combined the two commands for the cash and combine them into one command.\n",
    "- I did this by add the amount of money from the pretzels and the amount of money from the lemonade together in the same line.\n",
    "- to make writing each customer's order easier, I created five different parameters within five different functions.\n",
    "- I made a function for the cash, tips, lemonade and pretzels.\n",
    "- In each function I made a parameter linking each piece I have to print at the end to a variable.\n",
    "- I then called each function into another function \"serve_Customer\"\n",
    "- Putting them all into on function made it efficent because for the actual code, I only need to call one funcion.\n",
    "- in the code, I assigned pretzels to x, lemonade to y, and tips to z.\n",
    "- I assgined each of the orders from the customers into the called function. \n",
    "- Each customer had one line of code instead of six like the original.\n",
    "- after filling in all 15 orders I ran the function and the print was the same as the wet code.\n",
